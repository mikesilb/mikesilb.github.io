    <h1>Mike's Favorite Hobbies</h1>
      <h2>The rock band,<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(band)>RUSH</a></h2>
      <p><img src=http://www.rush.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/rush-cover-600x600.jpg><img src=http://www.metalinjection.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/rush.jpg> RUSH is a three-membered progressive rock band from Toronto, ON, Canada.  They consist of singer and bassist, Geddy Lee, guitarist, Alex Lifeson, and drummer Neil Peart.  The band has been in existence for over 40 years.  Their music is technically as sharp as it comes and their sound takes you to a different galaxy altogether.</p>
