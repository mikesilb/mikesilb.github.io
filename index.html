    <h1>Mike's Favorite Hobbies</h1>
      <h2>The rock band, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(band)>RUSH</a></h2>
      <p><img src=http://www.rush.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/rush-cover-600x600.jpg alt="RUSH logo"><img src=http://www.metalinjection.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/rush.jpg alt="Band pic"> RUSH is a three-membered progressive rock band from Toronto, ON, Canada.  They consist of singer and bassist, Geddy Lee, guitarist, Alex Lifeson, and drummer Neil Peart.  The band has been in existence for over 40 years.  Their music is technically as sharp as it comes and their sound takes you to a different galaxy altogether.</p>
      <h2>The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers>Los Angeles Lakers</a></h2>

      <p>I have been a Laker fan since 1981 as I was raised in Los Angeles.  I have seen three different championship dynasties in my lifetime:</p>

      <h2><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_type>Personality Typology Theories</a></h2>
      <p>I am very interested in understanding what makes people tick.  Likewise, I am fascinated when certain personality type models can predict and somewhat approximate how I perceive the world, and how respond to all sorts of stimuli.  Below are two such typological models that I enjoy learning and applying...</p>

        <h3><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator>Myers-Briggs</a></h3>
        <p><a href=http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/pleaseteacher/images/6/66/Mbti-picture.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130618154242>Sixteen types</a>.  Cognitively-oriented model based on how we perceive information and make judgements</p>
        <h3><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality>Enneagram</a></h3>
        <p><a href=http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5776a7d3f7e0abdb5cefa508/t/57b13838b8a79bc753cd67f6/1471232059565/>Nine types</a>.  All based on various ego fixations.  Circular model.</p>
      <h2>Map Reading</h2>
      <p>Ever since I was a young child, I was fascinated by the interwoven complexity of maps.  I literally could spend hours in front of one and feel mesmerized by all its inherent possibilities (as to various trips someone can take).  The specific maps where my intrigue in this area began are:</p>
