      <h2>The rock band, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(band)>RUSH</a></h2>

They consist of singer and bassist, Geddy Lee, guitarist, Alex Lifeson, and drummer Neil Peart.  The band has been in existence for over 40 years.  Their music is technically as sharp as it comes and their sound takes you to a different galaxy altogether.</p>
      <h2>The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers>Los Angeles Lakers</a></h2>

      <p>I have been a Laker fan since 1981 as I was raised in Los Angeles.  I have witnessed three different championship dynasties in my lifetime:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The Showtime Years (1980-1987).  Notable players include Earvin Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, James Worthy, and Michael Cooper.  Championships include 1980, 1982, 1985, and 1987.</li>
        <li>The Shaq-Kobe Years (1996-2004). Notable players include Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Derek Fisher, Robert Horry, and Rick Fox.  Championships include 2000, 2001, and 2002.</li>
        <li>The Kobe-Pau Years (2008-2011).  Notable players include Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Derek Fisher, Lamar Odom, and Andrew Bynum.  Championships include 2009 and 2010.</li>

      <h2><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_type>Personality Typology Theories</a></h2>
      <p>I am very interested in understanding what makes people tick.  Likewise, I am fascinated when certain personality type models can predict and somewhat approximate how I perceive the world, and how respond to all sorts of stimuli.  Below are two such typological models that I enjoy learning and applying...</p>

      <h2>Map Reading</h2>
      <p>Ever since I was a young child, I was fascinated by the interwoven complexity of maps.  I literally could spend hours in front of one and feel mesmerized by all its inherent possibilities (as to various trips someone can take).  The specific maps where my intrigue in this area began are:</p>
